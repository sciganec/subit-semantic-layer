# SUBIT‑64 Glossary
### Canonical Definitions of Core Terms

This glossary defines the core concepts, structures, and terminology used throughout the SUBIT‑64 architecture.  
All terms are canonical and consistent with the specification in `/spec/`.

---

# A

### **Archetype (64‑Ontology)**
A semantic mode selected by the interpreter that shapes reasoning style, basin type, and cognitive direction.  
One of 64 canonical archetypes.

### **Archetype Selector**
A module that maps input features to one of the 64 archetypes.

---

# B

### **Basin (Semantic Basin)**
A topological attractor representing a stable cognitive mode.  
Determined by archetype and refined by reasoning output.

### **Behavioral Mask**
A persona‑level structure defining tone, voice, pacing, and expression constraints.

### **Bifurcation Point**
A topological threshold where the cognitive trajectory may shift to a different basin.

---

# C

### **Canonical Packet**
A structured data object passed between layers (interpreter → reasoning → topology → persona).

### **Content Topology**
The spatial semantic representation of reasoning: basins, gradients, curvature, transitions.

### **Curvature**
A measure of local instability in the semantic field.  
Higher curvature → higher instability.

---

# D

### **Distilled Insight**
The compressed core meaning produced by the reasoning layer after convergence.

### **Dominant Trajectory**
The reasoning path selected after evaluating hypotheses.

---

# E

### **Expression Layer**
The persona layer responsible for final message formatting and tone.

### **Evidence Mapping**
Analytical technique used by Analyst‑type personas to evaluate claims.

---

# F

### **Frame Seed**
A structural seed generated by the interpreter that initializes reasoning context.

### **Field Map**
A semantic field constructed from basin + gradient, representing local structure.

---

# G

### **Gradient (Semantic Gradient)**
A directional vector derived from shadow tension and reasoning trajectory.  
Indicates slope and direction of cognitive movement.

---

# H

### **Hypothesis Expansion**
The reasoning process of generating multiple candidate interpretations or solutions.

---

# I

### **Interpreter Layer**
The first layer of SUBIT‑64.  
Extracts seeds, selects archetype, computes shadow, initializes sense10.

### **Instability Factors**
Topological indicators that reduce basin stability (e.g., high curvature, strong gradient).

---

# M

### **MIST (Modular Insight Synthesis Tree)**
The reasoning engine responsible for hypothesis generation, evaluation, and convergence.

### **Memory Layer**
Optional layer storing previous states for multi‑step or multi‑turn agents.

---

# O

### **Ontology‑64**
The canonical set of 64 archetypes used by SUBIT‑64.

---

# P

### **Persona**
A behavioral mask applied at the final stage to shape expression without altering reasoning.

### **Persona Layer**
The final layer that transforms neutral reasoning into expressive output.

---

# R

### **Reasoning Layer**
The second layer of SUBIT‑64.  
Produces hypotheses, trajectories, and distilled insight.

### **Reasoning Packet**
The structured output of the reasoning layer.

---

# S

### **Sense10**
A 10‑dimensional semantic vector representing the initial cognitive state.

### **Shadow (Shadow Axis)**
A tension parameter that influences gradient strength and reasoning convergence.

### **Stability Score**
A measure of how stable the current basin is.

### **Structural Map**
A topological representation of basin, gradient, and curvature.

---

# T

### **Topology Layer**
The third layer of SUBIT‑64.  
Maps reasoning into basins, gradients, curvature, and transitions.

### **Topology Packet**
The structured output of the topology layer.

### **Transition Prediction**
A topological estimate of the next likely basin.

---

# U

### **Unified Topology Packet**
The final integrated topology structure combining basin, gradient, curvature, transition, and stability.

---

# W

### **Whitepaper**
The theoretical foundation of SUBIT‑64, located in `/whitepaper/`.

---

# Summary

This glossary defines the core vocabulary of SUBIT‑64.  
All terms are canonical and consistent across interpreter, reasoning, topology, and persona layers.
