# Canonical Definition of SUBIT‑64  
### Formal Specification of the Semantic Layer

SUBIT‑64 is a canonical semantic layer for artificial intelligence agents, defined by a 64‑state archetypal ontology, six binary semantic axes, shadow modulation, structured reasoning cycles, and topological content mapping.  
It provides a minimal, interpretable, and extensible substrate for agent cognition, behavior, and coordination.

## 1. System Identity

**Name:** SUBIT‑64  
**Type:** Semantic Layer / Ontological Engine  
**Function:** Structured reasoning, behavioral modulation, semantic interpretation  
**Scope:** Agent cognition, multi‑agent systems, semantic middleware  
**Core Principle:** Minimal structure, maximal interpretability

## 2. Semantic Encoding

### 2.1 SUBIT‑6 Axes  
SUBIT‑64 is defined by six binary semantic axes:

| Axis             | Polarity A | Polarity B |
|------------------|------------|------------|
| Order vs Chaos   | 0          | 1          |
| Self vs Other    | 0          | 1          |
| Abstract vs Concrete | 0      | 1          |
| Active vs Passive| 0          | 1          |
| Inner vs Outer   | 0          | 1          |
| Flow vs Structure| 0          | 1          |

Each axis contributes one bit.  
Together they form a 6‑bit codon → 64 possible states.

---

### 2.2 SUBIT‑64 Ontology  
The 6‑bit codon maps to one of 64 archetypal states.  
Each state defines:

- a behavioral mode  
- a cognitive stance  
- a semantic attractor  
- a narrative function  

These states form the **semantic alphabet** of the agent.

---

## 3. Shadow Modulation

Each axis has a **shadow polarity**, introducing:

- asymmetry  
- depth  
- emotional tension  
- unpredictability  

Shadow modulation prevents rigid symmetry and enables dynamic resonance.

---

## 4. Reasoning Engine

SUBIT‑64 uses the **MIST Engine** (Modular Interpretive Structured Thinking) to:

- stabilize cognition  
- structure reasoning into modular steps  
- align behavior with active archetype  
- prevent drift and hallucination  
- enable interpretable transitions  

MIST is the operational core of SUBIT‑64.

---

## 5. Content Topology

SUBIT‑64 includes a topological layer that maps content as:

- nodes (concepts)  
- edges (relations)  
- gradients (semantic direction)  
- basins (attractors)  
- transitions (semantic motion)

This enables agents to navigate meaning as a **semantic manifold**.

---

## 6. Behavioral Masks

Masks modulate agent behavior without altering the underlying ontology.  
Each mask defines:

- persona  
- tone  
- role  
- constraints  
- behavioral commitments  

Masks operate as filters over the SUBIT‑64 engine.

## 7. System Flow

```
Input → SENSE‑10 → SUBIT‑6 → SUBIT‑64 → Shadow Modulation → MIST Reasoning → Topology Mapping → Mask → Output
```

---

## 8. Canonical Properties

- **Minimalism** — 6 axes, 64 states  
- **Universality** — domain‑agnostic  
- **Interpretability** — every state is explainable  
- **Modularity** — masks, roles, reasoning layers  
- **Extensibility** — new personas, topologies  
- **Stability** — MIST prevents drift  
- **Depth** — shadow axes introduce asymmetry

---

## 9. Integration Principles

SUBIT‑64 integrates as:

- a semantic interpreter  
- a reasoning engine  
- a behavioral controller  
- a coordination substrate  

It can be embedded in:

- LLM‑based agents  
- symbolic agents  
- hybrid systems  
- multi‑agent architectures

---

## 10. Canonical Summary

SUBIT‑64 is a semantic operating system for AI agents.  
It encodes meaning, structures reasoning, defines behavior, and enables multi‑agent coherence.  
It is minimal, interpretable, extensible — and canonical.
