# MIST Reasoning Engine  
### Canonical Specification of Modular Interpretive Structured Thinking  
### Cognitive Runtime of the SUBIT‑64 Architecture

The MIST Reasoning Engine is the **core cognitive engine** of SUBIT‑64.  
It transforms semantic initialization (archetype + shadow + axes + SENSE‑10) into **structured, interpretable, stable reasoning**.

MIST is not a heuristic.  
It is a **deterministic cognitive pipeline**.

---

# 1. Purpose of the MIST Engine

MIST provides:

- structured reasoning cycles  
- semantic stability  
- interpretive coherence  
- archetype‑aligned cognition  
- shadow‑modulated depth  
- topological readiness  
- predictable cognitive behavior  

MIST is the **thinking layer** of SUBIT‑64.

# 2. Position in the Architecture

```
Interpreter → SUBIT‑64 → Shadow → **MIST** → Topology → Mask → Output
```

MIST receives a semantic packet and produces a structured cognitive packet.

# 3. Core Principles

### **3.1 Modularity**
Reasoning is composed of discrete, reusable modules.

### **3.2 Interpretive Structure**
Each module interprets content through the active archetype.

### **3.3 Stability**
MIST prevents semantic drift by anchoring reasoning to:
- archetype  
- axes  
- shadow  
- gradients  

### **3.4 Transparency**
Every reasoning step is explainable.

### **3.5 Constraint‑Driven**
Archetype + shadow define the reasoning constraints.

---

# 4. MIST Cognitive Cycle (Canonical)

The MIST cycle consists of **six deterministic steps**:

### **Step 1 — Framing**
Define the semantic frame based on:
- archetype  
- axes  
- shadow  
- SENSE‑10  

Output: interpretive stance.

---

### **Step 2 — Extraction**
Identify semantic primitives:
- entities  
- relations  
- tensions  
- goals  
- ambiguities  
- risks  

Output: extracted semantic set.

---

### **Step 3 — Structuring**
Organize extracted elements into:
- hierarchies  
- clusters  
- contrasts  
- causal chains  
- decision trees  
- narrative arcs  

Output: internal semantic structure.

---

### **Step 4 — Interpretation**
Apply archetypal logic to the structured data:
- meaning assignment  
- stance selection  
- constraint application  
- attractor alignment  

Output: interpreted structure.

---

### **Step 5 — Projection**
Generate forward‑moving cognitive trajectories:
- strategies  
- predictions  
- transformations  
- reframings  
- resolutions  

Output: projected semantic paths.

---

### **Step 6 — Consolidation**
Stabilize reasoning into a coherent cognitive packet:
- select dominant trajectory  
- resolve contradictions  
- compress structure  
- prepare topology‑ready output  

Output: final MIST packet.

---

# 5. MIST Modules (Subsystems)

MIST consists of **five modular subsystems**:

### **5.1 Frame Module**
Defines interpretive stance.

Inputs:
- archetype  
- shadow  
- axes  
- SENSE‑10  

---

### **5.2 Extraction Module**
Identifies semantic primitives.

Outputs:
- nodes  
- tensions  
- constraints  
- signals  

---

### **5.3 Structure Module**
Builds internal scaffolding.

Outputs:
- graphs  
- trees  
- clusters  
- causal maps  

---

### **5.4 Interpretation Module**
Applies archetypal logic.

Outputs:
- meaning assignments  
- stance alignment  
- attractor mapping  

---

### **5.5 Projection Module**
Generates future‑oriented reasoning.

Outputs:
- trajectories  
- strategies  
- transformations  

---

# 6. MIST Constraints

Each archetype defines:

- allowed reasoning modes  
- forbidden reasoning modes  
- preferred cognitive patterns  
- risk zones  
- attractor tendencies  

Shadow modifies:

- intensity  
- direction  
- stability  

MIST must always operate **within** these constraints.

---

# 7. Interaction with Shadow Axes

Shadow affects MIST by:

- distorting the frame  
- amplifying or suppressing modules  
- shifting interpretive stance  
- altering projection trajectories  

Example:

**Strategist (000101)**  
- Light shadow → flexible optimization  
- Medium shadow → over‑control  
- Heavy shadow → paralysis  

---

# 8. Interaction with Semantic Topology

MIST produces a structured cognitive packet, which is then:

- spatialized  
- stabilized  
- embedded into attractor basins  

MIST → topology = **reasoning → meaning‑space**.

---

# 9. MIST Output Format

The MIST Engine outputs a **semantic reasoning packet**:

```
{
  frame: <interpretive stance>,
  extracted: <semantic primitives>,
  structure: <internal graph>,
  interpretation: <archetype-aligned meaning>,
  projections: <trajectories>,
  consolidated: <final cognitive packet>
}
```

This packet is consumed by the topology layer.

---

# 10. Canonical Example (Abstract)

```
Input: "Help me plan a project."

Archetype: 000101 (Strategist)
Shadow: low

MIST Cycle:
  Frame: optimization under constraint
  Extraction: goals, constraints, resources
  Structure: dependency graph
  Interpretation: alignment logic
  Projection: 3 possible plans
  Consolidation: optimal path
```

---

# 11. Why the MIST Engine Matters

MIST provides:

- predictable reasoning  
- interpretable cognition  
- semantic stability  
- archetype‑aligned behavior  
- nonlinear depth via shadow  
- topological readiness  

It is the **cognitive engine** that makes SUBIT‑64 a functional semantic system.

---

# 12. Canonical Summary

The MIST Reasoning Engine transforms semantic initialization into structured cognition.  
It ensures that every agent response is **grounded, stable, interpretable, and archetype‑aligned**.  
MIST is the deterministic reasoning core of SUBIT‑64.
