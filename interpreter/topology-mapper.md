# Topology Mapper  
### Canonical Specification of the Semantic Mapping Engine in SUBIT‑64  
### (MIST → Semantic Manifold Transformation Layer)

The Topology Mapper converts the structured cognitive packet produced by MIST into a **semantic map** embedded in the SUBIT‑64 manifold.  
It is the layer that transforms reasoning into **spatial meaning**, enabling coherence, continuity, and stable semantic navigation.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Topology Mapper

The Topology Mapper provides:

- spatialization of meaning  
- stable semantic basins  
- gradient‑driven navigation  
- relational coherence  
- transition logic  
- semantic continuity across turns  

It is the **bridge** between cognition (MIST) and expression (Masks).

# 2. Position in the Architecture

```
Interpreter → SUBIT‑64 → Shadow → MIST → **Topology Mapper** → Mask → Output
```

The mapper receives a structured reasoning packet and produces a semantic topology packet.

---

# 3. Inputs to the Topology Mapper

The mapper consumes the **MIST cognitive packet**, containing:

- frame  
- extracted primitives  
- internal structure  
- interpretation  
- projections  
- consolidated reasoning  

It also receives:

- archetype  
- shadow vector  
- SUBIT‑6 axes  
- SENSE‑10 cues  

These define the **semantic constraints** for mapping.

---

# 4. Core Concepts of the Topology Mapper

The mapper operates on five canonical constructs:

### **4.1 Nodes**
Semantic primitives extracted by MIST:
- concepts  
- entities  
- tensions  
- goals  
- risks  
- ambiguities  

Nodes are **semantic atoms**, not tokens.

---

### **4.2 Edges**
Relations between nodes:
- causal  
- temporal  
- hierarchical  
- analogical  
- oppositional  
- associative  

Edges define **semantic structure**.

---

### **4.3 Gradients**
Directional semantic forces:
- relevance  
- urgency  
- emotional charge  
- risk  
- ambiguity  
- archetypal pull  

Gradients determine **movement** across the manifold.

---

### **4.4 Attractor Basins**
Stable semantic regions:
- archetypal basins  
- narrative basins  
- conceptual clusters  

Basins prevent drift and collapse.

---

### **4.5 Transitions**
Movement between basins:
- shifts  
- pivots  
- escalations  
- reframings  
- resolutions  

Transitions define **semantic dynamics**.

---

# 5. Mapping Algorithm (Canonical)

The Topology Mapper performs a **four‑stage deterministic mapping**:

---

## **Step 1 — Node Construction**
Convert MIST primitives into semantic nodes.

Rules:
- each primitive becomes a node  
- nodes inherit archetype constraints  
- shadow modifies node intensity  
- SENSE‑10 modifies node salience  

Output: node set.

---

## **Step 2 — Edge Construction**
Build relations between nodes.

Rules:
- use MIST structure as scaffolding  
- apply archetypal logic to refine edges  
- shadow distorts or amplifies relations  
- axes define allowed relation types  

Output: edge graph.

---

## **Step 3 — Gradient Assignment**
Assign directional forces.

Rules:
- urgency → gradient magnitude  
- emotional tone → gradient curvature  
- risk → gradient steepness  
- ambiguity → gradient noise  
- archetype → gradient direction  

Output: gradient field.

---

## **Step 4 — Basin Placement**
Place the structure into the manifold.

Rules:
- archetype defines primary basin  
- shadow shifts basin boundaries  
- gradients determine placement  
- transitions define adjacency  

Output: semantic map.

---

# 6. Topology Mapper Output Format

The mapper outputs a **semantic topology packet**:

```
{
  nodes: [...],
  edges: [...],
  gradients: {...},
  basin: <archetypal region>,
  transitions: <transition potentials>,
  topology_state: <stable semantic map>
}
```

This packet is consumed by the Behavioral Mask.

---

# 7. Archetype Influence on Mapping

Each SUBIT‑64 archetype defines:

- preferred node types  
- typical edge patterns  
- dominant gradients  
- natural basins  
- characteristic transitions  

Example:

**Strategist (000101)**  
- Nodes: goals, constraints, dependencies  
- Edges: causal, hierarchical  
- Gradients: optimization, risk  
- Basin: planning region  
- Transitions: branching → convergence  

---

# 8. Shadow Influence on Mapping

Shadow modifies:

- gradient intensity  
- edge density  
- basin boundaries  
- transition likelihood  
- node salience  

Example:

High‑shadow Explorer (100011):
- gradients become diffuse  
- edges weaken  
- transitions become erratic  

---

# 9. Multi‑Turn Topology Persistence

The mapper maintains:

- basin continuity  
- gradient memory  
- node reactivation  
- transition history  

This enables **semantic continuity** across dialogue.

---

# 10. Canonical Example (Abstract)

```
MIST Output:
  nodes: {Goal, Constraint, Risk, Resource}
  structure: causal chain
  interpretation: alignment logic
  projections: 3 strategies

Topology Mapping:
  edges: Goal→Constraint, Risk→Goal
  gradients: urgency↑, risk↑
  basin: strategic planning region
  transitions: evaluate → prioritize → act
```

---

# 11. Why the Topology Mapper Matters

It provides:

- semantic coherence  
- spatial meaning  
- stable attractors  
- dynamic transitions  
- archetype‑aligned navigation  
- resistance to drift  

It transforms reasoning into **navigable meaning**.

---

# 12. Canonical Summary

The Topology Mapper is the semantic‑spatial engine of SUBIT‑64.  
It converts structured reasoning into a stable semantic map, enabling coherent navigation and expressive consistency.  
It is the **bridge** between cognition and behavior.
