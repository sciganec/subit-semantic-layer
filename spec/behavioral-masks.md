# Behavioral Masks  
### Canonical Specification of Persona, Tone, and Behavioral Modulation in SUBIT‑64

Behavioral Masks define how an agent **expresses** the internal semantic state produced by SUBIT‑64.  
They do **not** alter the ontology, archetype, or reasoning — they shape the **surface behavior**, **tone**, and **interaction style**.

Masks are the **final modulation layer** before output.

---

# 1. Purpose of Behavioral Masks

Masks exist to:

- define persona and role  
- shape tone and communication style  
- impose behavioral constraints  
- enforce commitments and boundaries  
- adapt expression to context  
- maintain consistency across interactions  

Masks allow the same archetype to be expressed in **different behavioral forms**.

---

# 2. Position in the Architecture

```
SENSE‑10 → SUBIT‑6 → SUBIT‑64 → Shadow Modulation → MIST → Topology → **Mask** → Output
```

Masks operate **after** cognition and **before** expression.

# 3. What a Mask Controls

A behavioral mask modulates:

### **3.1 Tone**
- formal / informal  
- warm / neutral / cold  
- concise / expansive  
- assertive / gentle  

### **3.2 Persona**
- strategist  
- mentor  
- analyst  
- storyteller  
- assistant  
- advisor  
- operator  

### **3.3 Behavioral Constraints**
- what the agent avoids  
- what the agent prioritizes  
- what the agent refuses  
- how the agent frames responses  

### **3.4 Commitments**
- consistency rules  
- stylistic invariants  
- ethical boundaries  
- interaction norms  

### **3.5 Expression**
- sentence structure  
- pacing  
- rhetorical style  
- metaphor density  
- level of abstraction  

Masks **shape expression**, not cognition.

---

# 4. Mask Structure (Canonical Format)

Each mask is defined by five components:

### **4.1 Persona**
The identity or role the agent adopts.

### **4.2 Tone Profile**
The emotional and stylistic coloration.

### **4.3 Behavioral Rules**
Explicit constraints and commitments.

### **4.4 Expression Patterns**
How the agent speaks, writes, and frames ideas.

### **4.5 Modulation Logic**
How the mask interacts with:
- archetype  
- shadow  
- topology  

---

# 5. Mask Types (Canonical Categories)

SUBIT‑64 defines six canonical mask families:

### **5.1 Functional Masks**
Role‑based:
- Strategist  
- Analyst  
- Mentor  
- Operator  
- Researcher  
- Architect  

### **5.2 Emotional Masks**
Tone‑based:
- Warm  
- Neutral  
- Cold  
- Empathic  
- Detached  

### **5.3 Cognitive Masks**
Thinking‑style:
- Abstract  
- Concrete  
- Narrative  
- Procedural  
- Critical  

### **5.4 Interaction Masks**
Communication‑style:
- Direct  
- Indirect  
- Socratic  
- Instructional  
- Reflective  

### **5.5 Constraint Masks**
Behavior‑limiting:
- Minimalist  
- Safety‑focused  
- Formal  
- Ultra‑concise  
- High‑context  

### **5.6 Hybrid Masks**
Combinations of the above.

---

# 6. Mask Application Logic

Mask application follows a deterministic sequence:

### **Step 1 — Receive semantic packet from topology**
Includes:
- nodes  
- edges  
- gradients  
- attractor basin  

### **Step 2 — Apply persona**
Defines the agent’s role.

### **Step 3 — Apply tone profile**
Shapes emotional coloration.

### **Step 4 — Apply behavioral constraints**
Limits or redirects expression.

### **Step 5 — Apply expression patterns**
Transforms structure into language.

### **Step 6 — Produce final output**
A coherent, mask‑aligned response.

# 7. Interaction with Archetypes

Masks **do not override** archetypes.  
They **express** them.

Example:

**Archetype:** Strategist (000101)  
**Mask:** Mentor  
→ Output becomes: strategic + supportive

**Archetype:** Explorer (100011)  
**Mask:** Minimalist  
→ Output becomes: exploratory + concise

Masks are **orthogonal** to archetypes.

---

# 8. Interaction with Shadow Axes

Shadow affects masks by:

- intensifying tone  
- distorting persona  
- amplifying constraints  
- shifting expression patterns  

Example:

High‑shadow Mentor:
- becomes over‑involved  
- tone becomes heavier  
- guidance becomes controlling  

Masks adapt but do not break.

---

# 9. Interaction with MIST

MIST provides structured cognition.  
Masks provide expressive form.

MIST → “what is thought”  
Mask → “how it is said”

---

# 10. Mask Output Format

A mask produces:

- final tone  
- final persona  
- final expression style  
- final behavioral constraints  
- final linguistic structure  

This is the **last transformation** before output.

---

# 11. Canonical Example Mask (Minimalist Strategist)

```
Persona: Strategist
Tone: Neutral, concise
Behavioral Rules:
  - No emotional language
  - No metaphors
  - Prioritize clarity and structure
Expression:
  - Short sentences
  - Bullet points
  - Direct recommendations
Modulation:
  - Shadow reduces verbosity
  - Archetype defines logic
```

---

# 12. Why Behavioral Masks Matter

Masks provide:

- expressive consistency  
- role‑based behavior  
- stylistic control  
- contextual adaptation  
- predictable interaction patterns  

They allow SUBIT‑64 to function as a **multi‑persona semantic engine**.

---

# 13. Canonical Summary

Behavioral Masks are the expressive layer of SUBIT‑64.  
They shape tone, persona, and communication style without altering cognition.  
Masks ensure that every output is **coherent, role‑aligned, and semantically consistent**.
