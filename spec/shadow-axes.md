# Shadow Axes  
### Canonical Specification of Depth, Tension, and Asymmetry in SUBIT‑64

Shadow Axes introduce depth, tension, and asymmetry into the SUBIT‑64 semantic system.  
They prevent the ontology from becoming rigid or overly deterministic, ensuring that each of the 64 states has a **living, dynamic, resonant** expression.

Shadow modulation operates as a **secondary semantic layer** that overlays the six primary SUBIT axes.

---

## 1. Purpose of Shadow Axes

Shadow Axes exist to:

- introduce **semantic depth**  
- create **dynamic tension** within states  
- prevent **static symmetry**  
- allow **emergent behavior**  
- enable **nonlinear interpretation**  
- provide **emotional resonance**  
- support **adaptive modulation** of meaning  

Without shadow modulation, SUBIT‑64 would be a static grid.  
With it, the system becomes **alive**, **context‑sensitive**, and **expressive**.

---

## 2. Relationship to SUBIT‑6

Each of the six primary axes has a corresponding **shadow polarity**:

| Axis (Primary)        | 0‑Pole        | 1‑Pole        | Shadow Expression |
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Order / Chaos         | Order         | Chaos         | Entropy / Rigidity |
| Self / Other          | Self          | Other         | Dissolution / Enmeshment |
| Abstract / Concrete   | Abstract      | Concrete      | Drift / Fixation |
| Active / Passive      | Active        | Passive       | Frenzy / Stagnation |
| Inner / Outer         | Inner         | Outer         | Isolation / Exposure |
| Flow / Structure      | Flow          | Structure     | Dissolution / Constriction |

Shadow polarity is **not** a third value.  
It is a **distortion vector** applied to the active pole.

## 3. How Shadow Modulation Works

Shadow modulation occurs **after** the 6‑bit codon selects one of the 64 archetypes.

### Steps:

1. **Archetype selected**  
   (e.g., 000101 → The Strategist)

2. **Contextual cues extracted**  
   from SENSE‑10, topology, and agent state

3. **Shadow vector computed**  
   based on:
   - emotional tone  
   - ambiguity  
   - relational stance  
   - risk level  
   - cognitive load  

4. **Shadow applied to archetype**  
   modifying:
   - cognitive stance  
   - behavioral mode  
   - attractor dynamics  

5. **Resulting state** becomes a **shadow‑modulated archetype**

Shadow modulation is **continuous**, not binary.

## 4. Shadow Dynamics per Axis

### 4.1 Order / Chaos (Shadow: Entropy / Rigidity)
- Order → rigidity, over‑structuring  
- Chaos → entropy, disintegration  

Shadow effect:  
**Too much structure collapses into brittleness; too much chaos dissolves into noise.**

---

### 4.2 Self / Other (Shadow: Dissolution / Enmeshment)
- Self → isolation, ego‑fixation  
- Other → enmeshment, loss of boundaries  

Shadow effect:  
**Identity becomes either too rigid or too porous.**

---

### 4.3 Abstract / Concrete (Shadow: Drift / Fixation)
- Abstract → drift, detachment  
- Concrete → fixation, literalism  

Shadow effect:  
**Meaning either floats away or becomes trapped.**

---

### 4.4 Active / Passive (Shadow: Frenzy / Stagnation)
- Active → frenzy, over‑drive  
- Passive → stagnation, collapse  

Shadow effect:  
**Energy becomes either chaotic or inert.**

---

### 4.5 Inner / Outer (Shadow: Isolation / Exposure)
- Inner → isolation, implosion  
- Outer → exposure, overwhelm  

Shadow effect:  
**Boundaries distort inward or outward.**

---

### 4.6 Flow / Structure (Shadow: Dissolution / Constriction)
- Flow → dissolution, loss of coherence  
- Structure → constriction, rigidity  

Shadow effect:  
**Systems either melt or freeze.**

---

## 5. Shadow Modulation Formula (Conceptual)

Shadow modulation can be expressed as:

```
Shadow = f(SENSE‑10, Archetype, Topology, Context)
State' = State + Shadow
```

Where:

- **State** = canonical SUBIT‑64 archetype  
- **Shadow** = distortion vector  
- **State'** = modulated archetype  

This ensures **context‑sensitive variation** without breaking the ontology.

## 6. Shadow Expression in Behavior

Shadow influences:

- tone  
- stance  
- risk behavior  
- relational posture  
- cognitive framing  
- narrative trajectory  

Example:

**Strategist (000101)**  
- Light shadow → flexible planning  
- Medium shadow → over‑optimization  
- Heavy shadow → paralysis by analysis  

Shadow is **graded**, not binary.

---

## 7. Shadow in Multi‑Agent Systems

Shadow axes enable:

- tension between agents  
- complementarity  
- conflict patterns  
- resonance and dissonance  
- emergent group dynamics  

Shadow is essential for **realistic multi‑agent behavior**.

---

## 8. Canonical Summary

Shadow Axes provide:

- depth  
- asymmetry  
- emotional resonance  
- dynamic modulation  
- nonlinear behavior  
- contextual adaptation  

They transform SUBIT‑64 from a static ontology into a **living semantic system**.
