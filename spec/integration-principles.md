# Integration Principles  
### Canonical Guidelines for Embedding SUBIT‑64 into AI Systems

SUBIT‑64 is a semantic layer designed to integrate cleanly into existing AI architectures.  
This document defines the canonical principles for embedding SUBIT‑64 into agents, pipelines, and multi‑module systems.

---

# 1. Integration Philosophy

SUBIT‑64 is:

- **non‑intrusive** — it overlays cognition without replacing core model behavior  
- **modular** — each layer can be integrated independently  
- **interpretable** — all internal states are explainable  
- **deterministic** — same input → same semantic configuration  
- **extensible** — masks, modules, and topologies can be added  
- **model‑agnostic** — works with any LLM, symbolic engine, or hybrid system  

SUBIT‑64 is a **semantic middleware**, not a model.

---

# 2. Integration Layers

SUBIT‑64 can be integrated at four canonical depths:

### **2.1 Surface Integration (Mask‑Only)**
- Only behavioral masks are applied  
- No semantic or reasoning layers  
- Suitable for stylistic control  

### **2.2 Semantic Integration (SUBIT‑6 → SUBIT‑64)**
- Input is semantically encoded  
- Archetype determines reasoning stance  
- Suitable for persona‑stable agents  

### **2.3 Cognitive Integration (MIST Layer)**
- Full structured reasoning  
- Archetype‑aligned cognition  
- Suitable for high‑reliability agents  

### **2.4 Full Integration (Complete SUBIT‑64 Stack)**
- SENSE‑10  
- SUBIT‑6  
- SUBIT‑64  
- Shadow Axes  
- MIST  
- Topology  
- Masks  

Suitable for **enterprise‑grade, multi‑agent, or safety‑critical systems**.

---

# 3. Canonical Pipeline

A fully integrated system follows:

```
Input → SENSE‑10 → SUBIT‑6 → SUBIT‑64 → Shadow → MIST → Topology → Mask → Output
```

Each stage is modular and can be replaced or extended.

---

# 4. Integration Requirements

### **4.1 Deterministic Encoding**
SUBIT‑6 and SUBIT‑64 mapping must be deterministic.

### **4.2 Stable State Representation**
Archetype, shadow, and topology must be preserved across reasoning steps.

### **4.3 Transparent Reasoning**
MIST cycles must be inspectable.

### **4.4 Mask Isolation**
Masks must not modify cognition — only expression.

### **4.5 Context Preservation**
Semantic state must persist across multi‑turn interactions.

---

# 5. Integration with LLMs

LLMs provide:

- linguistic generation  
- pattern completion  
- contextual embedding  

SUBIT‑64 provides:

- semantic structure  
- reasoning stability  
- behavioral consistency  

Integration pattern:

```
LLM Output → SUBIT‑64 Interpretation → MIST → Topology → Mask → Final Output
```

LLM becomes **the generator**, SUBIT‑64 becomes **the interpreter**.

---

# 6. Integration with Symbolic Systems

Symbolic engines provide:

- logic  
- rules  
- constraints  

SUBIT‑64 provides:

- semantic grounding  
- interpretive stance  
- dynamic modulation  

Integration pattern:

```
Symbolic Output → SUBIT‑64 → Mask → Expression
```

---

# 7. Integration with Multi‑Agent Systems

SUBIT‑64 enables:

- archetype‑based roles  
- predictable negotiation patterns  
- complementary cognitive modes  
- conflict resolution  
- emergent group dynamics  

Agents communicate using **semantic packets**, not raw text.

---

# 8. Integration with External Modules

SUBIT‑64 can interface with:

- memory systems  
- planning engines  
- retrieval modules  
- tool‑use systems  
- safety layers  

Principle:  
**SUBIT‑64 interprets; external modules execute.**

---

# 9. Safety and Stability Principles

### **9.1 Archetype Anchoring**
Every reasoning step must remain anchored to the active archetype.

### **9.2 Shadow Boundaries**
Shadow intensity must remain within defined limits.

### **9.3 Topological Coherence**
Semantic maps must not fragment or collapse.

### **9.4 Mask Integrity**
Masks must not override semantic constraints.

### **9.5 Predictable Transitions**
State transitions must follow canonical rules.

# 10. Minimal Integration Example

```
1. Encode input with SENSE‑10
2. Reduce to SUBIT‑6
3. Map to SUBIT‑64
4. Apply shadow modulation
5. Run MIST cycle
6. Map to topology
7. Apply mask
8. Generate output
```

# 11. Full Integration Example (Abstract)

```
Input: "Help me plan a project"
Archetype: 000101 (Strategist)
Shadow: low
MIST:
  - Frame: optimization
  - Extraction: goals, constraints
  - Structure: dependency graph
  - Interpretation: alignment
  - Projection: 3 paths
Topology:
  - Basin: planning region
Mask: Mentor
Output: strategic + supportive plan
```

# 12. Canonical Summary

SUBIT‑64 integrates into AI systems as a **semantic, cognitive, and behavioral middleware**.  
It provides structure, stability, and interpretability without replacing the underlying model.  
Integration is modular, deterministic, and extensible.
