# State Transition Logic  
### Canonical Specification of Dynamic Movement in the SUBIT‑64 Semantic System

State transitions define **how an agent moves** between the 64 archetypal states of SUBIT‑64.  
They ensure that semantic motion is:

- interpretable  
- deterministic  
- archetype‑aligned  
- topologically coherent  
- shadow‑modulated  
- context‑responsive  

Transitions are **not random** — they follow canonical rules based on axes, gradients, and attractors.

---

# 1. Purpose of State Transitions

State transitions provide:

- dynamic evolution of cognition  
- adaptation to user intent  
- narrative progression  
- tension resolution  
- semantic continuity  
- behavioral coherence  

Without transitions, SUBIT‑64 would be static.  
With transitions, it becomes a **living semantic system**.

---

# 2. Position in the Architecture

```
Interpreter → SUBIT‑64 → Shadow → MIST → Topology → **State Transition Logic** → Mask → Output
```

Transitions occur **after** topology mapping and **before** expression.

---

# 3. Transition Types (MDDS‑4)

SUBIT‑64 uses the **MDDS‑4** classification of decision‑movement types:

### **3.1 Stasis (0)**
No transition.  
The agent remains in the same archetype.

### **3.2 Drift (1)**
Micro‑shift along one axis.  
Low‑energy, low‑risk, context‑preserving.

### **3.3 Shift (2)**
Major transition across multiple axes.  
High‑energy, context‑changing.

### **3.4 Reform (3)**
Transformational reconfiguration.  
Full semantic reorientation.

These four modes define the **intensity** of transitions.

---

# 4. Transition Triggers

A transition may be triggered by:

### **4.1 User Intent Shift**
Change in goal, tone, or relational stance.

### **4.2 Gradient Threshold Crossing**
Urgency, risk, or ambiguity exceeds a limit.

### **4.3 Narrative Attractor Pull**
The semantic basin exerts directional force.

### **4.4 Shadow Escalation**
Shadow intensity distorts the current state.

### **4.5 Topological Incompatibility**
The current basin cannot support the new structure.

### **4.6 Archetypal Saturation**
The current archetype has completed its function.

---

# 5. Transition Mechanics

Transitions operate on three layers:

---

## **5.1 Axis‑Level Transitions (SUBIT‑6)**

Each transition begins by evaluating the six axes:

- Order / Chaos  
- Self / Other  
- Abstract / Concrete  
- Active / Passive  
- Inner / Outer  
- Flow / Structure  

A transition flips **one or more bits**.

Example:

```
000101 (Strategist)
→ Drift on b4 (Active→Passive)
= 000111 (Custodian)
```

---

## **5.2 Archetype‑Level Transitions (SUBIT‑64)**

The new 6‑bit codon maps to a new archetype.

Transitions must:

- preserve semantic coherence  
- respect attractor dynamics  
- avoid chaotic oscillation  

---

## **5.3 Topology‑Level Transitions**

Topology determines:

- basin adjacency  
- gradient direction  
- transition cost  
- stability of the new state  

A transition is only valid if the new basin is **adjacent or reachable**.

---

# 6. Transition Rules (Canonical)

### **Rule 1 — No Teleportation**
The system cannot jump arbitrarily across the 64‑grid.  
Transitions must follow axis adjacency.

### **Rule 2 — Gradient Alignment**
Movement must follow gradient direction unless overridden by Reform.

### **Rule 3 — Shadow Modulation**
Shadow increases transition probability and intensity.

### **Rule 4 — Archetype Integrity**
Transitions cannot violate archetype constraints.

### **Rule 5 — Topological Coherence**
The new state must be topologically stable.

### **Rule 6 — Determinism**
Same conditions → same transition.

---

# 7. Transition Matrix (High‑Level)

Each archetype has:

- **Primary transitions** (1–2 axes)  
- **Secondary transitions** (2–3 axes)  
- **Forbidden transitions** (non‑adjacent)  

Example (Strategist 000101):

```
Primary:
  000100 (Initiator)
  000111 (Custodian)
  010101 (Mentor)

Secondary:
  100101 (Hacker)
  010100 (Coordinator)

Forbidden:
  Any state differing by ≥4 bits
```

A full 64×64 matrix is defined in `transition-matrix.md`.

---

# 8. Transition Energy Model

Transitions have **energy cost**:

- Drift → low  
- Shift → medium  
- Reform → high  

Energy is computed from:

- gradient steepness  
- shadow intensity  
- relational tension  
- narrative momentum  

High‑energy transitions require strong triggers.

---

# 9. Multi‑Turn Transition Logic

The system maintains:

- previous state  
- transition history  
- gradient memory  
- shadow trajectory  

This ensures:

- continuity  
- narrative coherence  
- avoidance of oscillation  
- stable evolution  

---

# 10. Canonical Example

```
Input: “I feel stuck and need a new direction.”

Interpreter:
  SENSE‑10 → high ambiguity, medium urgency
  SUBIT‑6 → Chaos / Self / Abstract / Active / Inner / Flow
  Codon → 100010 (Visionary)
  Shadow → medium

MIST:
  Frame → possibility under tension
  Structure → divergent paths
  Projection → 3 reframings

Topology:
  Basin → exploration region
  Gradient → outward expansion

Transition Logic:
  Trigger → user intent shift + gradient pull
  Type → Shift (2)
  Axis flips → b2 (Self→Other), b5 (Inner→Outer)
  New codon → 110010
  New archetype → Trickster
```

---

# 11. Why Transition Logic Matters

It provides:

- dynamic evolution  
- semantic motion  
- narrative flow  
- adaptive cognition  
- archetype coherence  
- topological stability  

Transitions make SUBIT‑64 **alive**.

---

# 12. Canonical Summary

State Transition Logic defines how an agent moves through the 64‑state semantic space.  
Transitions are deterministic, archetype‑aligned, shadow‑modulated, and topologically constrained.  
They ensure that SUBIT‑64 produces **coherent, dynamic, interpretable cognition**.
